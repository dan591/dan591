Hi, I am Daniel Kyere- 👋

I am interested in pursing higher education in transportation engineering.
with a focus on applying AI and deep learning models to dynamic traffic assignment, 
rail scheduling, and transportation planning. 

Currently, I am taking online courses on how to apply and deploy OpenCV to solve transportation problems. - 🌱

I am looking to collaborate on developing open-source systems that help cities build multimodal transportation systems that are equitable and sustainable- 💞️

You can reach me either on phone, or by email- 📫
